In the last century construction engineering as well aerospace engineering  were dominated by the materials steel, aluminum, and concrete. But especially in last decade civil engineers more than ever faced often contradictory demands for designing larger, safer and more durable structures at shorter time and lower costs. This lead to improvement of old and designing of new materials. Composites are a key element of those new designs.

Composite materials often combine positive characteristic properties from more, typically two, different materials which result to better material properties. In many cases these combine a load carrying constituent, typically in the form of carbon or glass fibers, bonded to the cement or polymer based matrices. Their applications can be found in transportation as well as in civil engineering fields. In the aerospace industry we can found entire structural members made of composite materials, but in the building industry the use of polymer-based composites is limited. A typical area are members applied to existing concrete or masonry such as adhesive anchors. The commonly used polymers, typically utilized, are exothermically reacting, thermosets, e.g. epoxies or vinyl-esters. They have high filler content (including even cement and water). They have uncertain curing level and the mechanical properties due to the environmental conditions (a fully cured state is not usually reached).

Also a large range of working temperatures, which are typically expected during the lifetime leads to a post-curing and related changes in mechanical properties. These changes highly impact, in particular, structures under sustained or cyclic loads. For these challenges, the characterization of this type of materials is in high demand.  

The first chapter is focused on the description of anchors, the distribution according to the installation time and the load transfer mechanism, further failure modes of anchors are described. The second chapter is focused on thermosets, used types of polymers with anchors and overall material properties. In the third chapter models used for numerical simulation of thermoset polymers are introduced. As first of them, a non-associated Drucker-Prager model used for calculation of current stress and strain in time is explained. Then the curing model employed to calculate an evolution of material parameters is described. The fourth chapter is focused on the results and their comparison with experimental test data.
