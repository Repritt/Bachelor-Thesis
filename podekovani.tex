I would like to say thank to my supervisor, Doc. Ing. Jan Vorel, Ph.D., for his time, patience and for incessantly explaining the same things to me all over again. I would like to thank to my friends and classmates for their support and continuous motivation. Great thanks also belong to my family and especially my girlfriend Radka Sochorov√° for their psychical support for the duration of making this thesis.
